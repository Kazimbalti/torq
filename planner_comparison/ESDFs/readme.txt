ESDFs - Euclidean Signed Distance Fields. 

Being large files, these are stored on dropbox: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/rahfytrn0ketqnz/AACa0KhhJI25hsauFhokvw13a?dl=0

These are intended to be loaded with the TORQ GCS: https://github.com/genemerewether/torq/tree/dev/planner_comparison_2018_07
Use the "planner_comparison_2018_07" branch for the tests. 

See tutorial here for details: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K9KlNsZem-DPdRAYymNsHnRT9RBEyrXbSweh557lFo4/edit?usp=sharing

The ESDF files are the *.proto files. 

Also included in these folders are mesh files for visualising the environments in the GCS. These are *.ply files for the Medium and Large lab environments, and the *.dae (and associated files) for the Flight Tests environment
