When using the waypoint set for the flight tests, the TORQ GCS should be used: https://github.com/genemerewether/torq/tree/dev/planner_comparison_2018_07
Use the "planner_comparison_2018_07" branch for the tests. 

When simplifying the waypoints, an epsilon value of 0.7 should be used. See tutorial here for details: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K9KlNsZem-DPdRAYymNsHnRT9RBEyrXbSweh557lFo4/edit?usp=sharing
